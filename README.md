# React Authentication with Token-Based System (Training Project)

This project is a training exercise designed to help me learn and implement authentication using a token-based system. The focus is on understanding how to manage user access between public and private pages.

## Learning Objectives
- **Mock API Integration**: Using a mock API to simulate user authentication by returning a user token.
- **Building a Login Page**: Develop a login page that fetches the token and manages user authentication within the app.
- **Exploring Token Storage**: Experiment with storing tokens in `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, while understanding the security and user experience implications of each approach.
- **User Workflow Implementation**: Learn how to provide a smooth user experience by allowing users to log in and continue without being redirected to a dedicated login page.

This project is to learn web application security, and showcases my progress in building secure, user-friendly applications.
